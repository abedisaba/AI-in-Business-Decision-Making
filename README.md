## Introduction
The project explores the significance of AI in decision-making processes across various industries. It provides insights into how machine learning models can improve managerial decisions by analyzing data and predicting outcomes. Case studies from companies like Amazon and JPMorgan illustrate the practical applications of these technologies.

## Methodology
We employed several machine learning algorithms, including:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

Each model was chosen based on its suitability for the specific business problem, with detailed explanations provided in the methodology section.

## Results
The results section presents the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² values. Visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots are included to enhance understanding.

## Discussion
We discussed the implications of our findings, focusing on how businesses can apply these insights for strategic decision-making. The discussion also highlights the limitations of the models used and areas for future research.
